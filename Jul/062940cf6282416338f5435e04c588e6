He was captured by Misratan rebel fighters in Gaddafi's home town Sirte, the last bastion in the former leader's fight to hold onto power. Gaddafi was captured and killed in October 2011.Libya's new rulers, who aim to draw up a democratic constitution this year, are keen to try Gaddafi's family members and loyalists at home to show citizens that those who helped him stay in power for 42 years are being punished.Human rights activists worry legal proceedings will not meet international standards. Libya's weak central government is trying to reform the judiciary while struggling to stabilise the country and tame the militias that fought Gaddafi's forces.The most prominent person facing trial is Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam. Libya has appealed a ruling by the International Criminal Court (ICC) to hand him over to the tribunal, which wants to try him for alleged crimes committed during the 2011 uprising.Libya has challenged the ICC's right to put Saif al-Islam on trial on the grounds that it is planning its own proceedings. It argues the international court in The Hague has no jurisdiction because it should intervene only if the local legal system is not up to the task. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
