Northern Sinai government officials said on Sunday that the military envisioned creating a house-free zone with no trees 500m wide and 10km long starting at the Rafah border crossing. The officials said the homes with tunnels underneath them were bulldozed over the last 10 days as a test of the idea. The Egyptian military has closed much of the once-bustling tunnel system, but some remain at the 15km stretch of border.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
