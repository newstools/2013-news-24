back in court on 15 December, said police spokesperson Thulani Zwane. He was arrested at school at 09:30 on Thursday. He was in
an exam room at his school in Phoenix, north of Durban, when a teacher noticed
him acting suspiciously. "The pupil was taken to the office with his bag
where he was searched. In his bag an unlicensed firearm loaded with eight
rounds was found." Police were contacted and after arriving at the school
questioned the 18-year-old about the gun. He apparently took it from the safe
where his father kept it in. The teenager was arrested and charged with possession of
unlicensed firearm and ammunition. The father was also arrested on Thursday, and appeared in
court where the case against him was withdrawn. He was considering laying a charge of theft against his
son, Zwane said. Provincial commissioner Lieutenant General Mmamonnye
Ngobeni appealed to all legal gun owners to keep their firearms in safes, and
hide the keys so children could not find them. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
