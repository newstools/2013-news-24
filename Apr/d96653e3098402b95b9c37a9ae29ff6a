'We did,' she replied. 'I organised it'.""It was a conversation-stopper. I was stunned," Lea said, adding that he concluded from the exchange that whoever was directly culpable for Lumumba's death, the British government was "at the centre of the spider's web".His letter was in response to a new book on the British secret services called "Empire of Secrets: British Intelligence, the Cold War and the Twilight of Empire".Park is said to have had a high degree of influence in the region after she was appointed consul and first secretary in Leopoldville - now known as Kinshasa - in 1959, one year before DRC won its independence from Belgium.The CIA is also believed to have played a role in organising the plot to eliminate Lumumba, because of his growing alliance with the Soviet Union.Lumumba was killed by firing squad after a coup led by Joseph-Desire Mobutu. Mobutu renamed the country Zaire. It is now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo.Lumumba's death is to be the subject of a judicial probe in Belgium after a court gave the go-ahead last year.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
