A BIZARRE tale involving the sale of a cadaver from a state hospital and dressing a female corpse in a manâ€™s pyjamas to hoodwink a doctor has led to the arrest of six people in connection with insurance fraud.   One of the accused, Mduduzi Ndlela (50), is alleged to have taken out life cover with both Metropolitan and Liberty Life for his uncle who died in 2002. The policy was taken out after his uncle had been buried.
