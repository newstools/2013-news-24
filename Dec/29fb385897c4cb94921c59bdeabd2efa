Chris NdalisoMADIBA was like a father to Dr Albertina Luthuli, the daughter of the late struggle icon Chief Albert Luthuli. &ldquo;Now that he is gone, I&rsquo;m profoundly confused and saddened by his passing. He had the ability to make you feel safe, secure, and he was able to comfort people in times of trouble,&rdquo; Luthuli told Weekend Witness yesterday.She believes there was an irony in the manner in which she had heard about her own father&rsquo;s death, and that of Madiba. &ldquo;I heard about my father&rsquo;s death while I was driving home from work. It was broadcast on the radio that he was hit by a train. When I heard about Madiba&rsquo;s passing I was driving &hellip; how ironic?&rdquo; she said. Luthuli believes that the relationship between Madiba and her family has now been renewed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure my father on the other side has welcomed him with open arms because their relationship was so solid, because of the common purpose they had during the struggle,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;After the passing of my mother in early 2000, I knew that the only person I could look up to as a father was Madiba. I&rsquo;ve visited him with my two grandsons in Qunu. When my daughter got married after his term in office, I invited him. On the day of the wedding, he was held up in a meeting and he sent a message saying although he was delayed, he was still coming, and indeed he made it to the church. His passing is, indeed, a great loss, both to the Mandela family and the country as a whole,&rdquo; Luthuli said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
