Homes were also burnt in two other villages, said Captain Salisu Mustapha, spokesperson for a military task force in the region.He did not have a specific number of homes burnt, but said it was around 100. Residents were fleeing the area to find shelter and out of fears of further violence.According to Mustapha, homes were burnt in areas where the attackers fled by youths seeking revenge against the assailants."We now have a total of 48 dead from the attacks on three villages," Mustapha told AFP. He said the dead included 20 assailants killed in an hours-long gun battle by soldiers."Two suspected gunmen involved in the attacks were arrested with some arms and their motorcycles," said Mustapha.The villages attacked were Karkashi, Bolgang and Magama, and residents said the raids followed incidents of cattle rustling. Herdsmen from the mainly Muslim Fulani ethnic group were suspected to be behind the raids on the villages populated by the mainly Christian Taroks."The attackers withdrew towards Yamini, Yelwa Shendam and Agikamai villages," Mustapha said in a statement later in the day."However, some suspected Tarok youths set ablaze some settlements around Yamini and Agikamai while our own personnel were in pursuit of the assailants ..."He said more troops had been deployed and the situation had been brought under control.Thousands have been killed in Nigeria's central region in recent years in clashes between Muslim and Christian ethnic groups in a struggle for access to land or local power.Islamist extremist group Boko Haram, mainly based in the country's northeast, has occasionally carried out violence in the Middle Belt as well, but there was no sign of any link in Thursday's violence.Nigeria's military is currently engaged in an offensive in the northeast seeking to end Boko Haram's four-year insurgency.The country includes some 250 ethnic groups, and illegal weapons are widespread. Authorities have been largely unable to stop such violent flare-ups.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
