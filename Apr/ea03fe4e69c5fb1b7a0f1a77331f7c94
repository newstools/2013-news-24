It's no more than that," said Magdi El Gizouli, a fellow at the Rift Valley Institute."The regime is scare" He said Bashir will likely pardon some of the officers, whose goal is to replace Defence Minister Abdelrahim Mohammed Hussein and assume other key security roles."This is about some sort of [political] exchange, rather than a court procedure," Gizouli said.After Sunday's verdict, a regional political analyst said "the regime is scared" of its opponents and described the sentences as relatively light.The officers could have faced the firing squad.Most of the detainees are close to a vocal group of veterans of the 1983-2005 civil war with the now independent south, and an elite group of volunteer mujahedeen fighters among them called Al-Saihun or "tourists for the sake of God".Along with a youth movement within the ruling National Congress Party, the war veterans have called for new national leadership and a return to Islamic values because they said the government is tainted by corruption.The accused plotters were detained without any shots being fired.Authorities also arrested Salah Gosh, who served as national intelligence chief until 2009. As he is not a military officer, his case was to be heard later.Sudan has experienced at least seven coups or attempted coups in its 57 years of independence.There has been some easing of tension since early March when Sudan and South Sudan finally settled on detailed timetables to implement crucial economic and security pacts, after months of intermittent border clashes.Bashir then announced the amnesty, but no other prisoners are known to have been freed since the initial seven.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
