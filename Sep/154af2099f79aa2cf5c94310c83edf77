Police officials are there to ensure the safety and security of communities as mandated by the country's Constitution and not to be targets of heartless killers," said Western Cape police commissioner Lieutenant General Arno Lamoer."Today's court decision must serve as a good lesson that will send a strong message to other criminals, that the decision to kill our police is wrong on their part," he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
