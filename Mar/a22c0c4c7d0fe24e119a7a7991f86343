It also set aside four counts of attempted murder.The minister said reducing the sentence and convictions showed that the highest courts had not yet fully understood the need for consequences as a deterrent to dangerous behaviour on the road.Humphreys overtook a queue of cars waiting at the Buttskop level-crossing, Cape Town, on 25 August 2010, and tried to cross the railway line, even though the safety booms were down.Ten children died and four were seriously injured when the train hit his minibus.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
