	     Johannesburg - A permanent Special Investigating Unit (SIU) head is expected to be appointed by the end of February, Justice Minister Jeff Radebe said on Monday. "I expect that the permanent appointment to the SIU should be made before the end of February, so that process is on track," he said. "The SIU is an institution that forms an integral part of the criminal justice system, hence the appointment will strengthen the government's aggressive stance on corruption and maladministration in government." President Jacob Zuma appointed deputy National Director of Public Prosecutions, advocate Nomvula Mokhatla, to act as SIU head in December 2011. Mokhatla took over from Nomgcobo Jiba, who had been acting in the position since SIU head advocate Willem Heath resigned. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
