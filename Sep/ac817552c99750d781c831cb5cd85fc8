A credit controller at a Netcare hospital in Cape Town, who allegedly lodged false medical claims and channelled the payments into her bank account, appeared in the Bellville Specialised Commercial Crime Court.   In 2009, the Commissioner of Child Welfare appointed her as her niece’s guardian following her brother’s death. A trust was set up for the niece, administered by the Old Mutual Trust.
