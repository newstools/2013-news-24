A date has not yet been set.Opposition members have called for the resignation of Gnassingbe, who has won two elections, contested by the opposition, since being installed by the military in 2005 after the death of his father.His father Gnassingbe Eyadema ruled the west African nation of some six million people for 38 years with an iron fist.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
