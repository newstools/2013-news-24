Mayibongwe MaqhinaA DURBAN man was rushed to a local hospital yesterday after sustaining serious injuries after a rock was thrown at his car while travelling on the notorious N2 south near Chesterville.Rescue Care emergency services operations director Garrith Jamieson said their para&shy;medics were called to the highway just after 10&thinsp;am.&ldquo;Paramedics arrived to find the injured man on the side of the highway and immediately began stabilising him. The man had sustained serious facial injuries after the rock had broken his windscreen and hit him,&rdquo; said Jamieson. After the man was stabilised, he was taken to a hospital in Durban for further care.According to Jamieson, the injured man was travelling with a passenger when the incident happened.&ldquo;He managed to control the vehicle and then parked it on the side of the road before calling for medical help,&rdquo; he said.The police could not confirm if a case arising from the incident had been opened at any of the police stations in the area. Neither could they provide information on the extent of similar incidents in the area, once notorious for such incidents.However, spokesperson Colonel Vincent Mdunge said there had been a decrease in rock and stone-throwing incidents in the vicinity. &ldquo;This could be an isolated person or a group that may have taken chances. For the last two years we have had no such incidents.&rdquo;Mdunge also said in the past few years, hotspots for rock and stone throwing had been the Amanzimtoti and uMgababa bridges as well as Chesterville and uMkomaas intersections, among others, and the number of reported incidents had decreased.&ldquo;In the past there were teenagers who threw stones so that they could loot and rob when someone stopped. That has subsided due to police who patrol the highway with high-powered vehicles.&rdquo;Mdunge said the perpetrators were motivated by personal gain.&ldquo;These people throw rocks or stones so that when you stop to inspect the damage caused to your car, they then rob you, loot and steal your valuables,&rdquo; he said.Mdunge advised motorists to be vigilant.&ldquo;It is advisable for a victim not to stop but proceed to the nearest police station,&rdquo; he said.The KZN Transport Department condemned yesterday&rsquo;s incident, with spokesperson Kwanele Ncalane saying throwing rocks at vehicles was a serious concern.&ldquo;We are working as a department with municipalities to find systems to deal with people throwing the stones,&rdquo; Ncalane said.He said law enforcement agencies have been told to be on the lookout for these perpetrators.&ldquo;We urge peopel who are aware of the perpetrators to come to the party and when they witness these incidents, report it to traffic officers and the police,&rdquo; Ncalane said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
