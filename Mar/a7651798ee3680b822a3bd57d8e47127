	     Dar Es Salaam - A Tanzanian court on Thursday sentenced 52
followers of a controversial Muslim cleric to a year in jail. "The accused were found guilty of three offences
including conspiracy to commit an offence, unlawful assembly and rioting,"
Dar es Salaam state attorney Bernard Kongola, told AFP. The 52 are all supporters of cleric Sheikh Ponda Issa Ponda,
who himself is facing charges of theft, instigating violence and criminal
trespass - along with dozens of others - over October demonstrations in the
commercial capital of Dar es Salaam. Ponda's judgement is scheduled for April
18. The clashes at the time were sparked by rumours that a
12-year-old boy at a Christian school had urinated on a copy of the Koran,
according to the police. Kongola said those sentenced on Thursday had participated in
riots last month and held an illegal march demanding the release of the jailed
sheikh. Ponda is the head of Jumuiya ya wa Islamu, or the
"community of Islam", a group not recognised by the Tanzanian
government. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
