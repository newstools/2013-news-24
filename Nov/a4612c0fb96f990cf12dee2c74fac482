Libya has deported more than 500 African immigrants, state news agency Lana
said, sending them to Niger as it tries to tackle an influx of refugees and
Islamist militants. Western
powers fear Libya has become a safe haven for al-Qaeda fighters as its
government struggles to rein in militias and former rebels who helped topple
Muammar Gaddafi two years ago. Weak border
controls and a small army lacking training and equipment have turned Libya into
a weapons smuggling route for al-Qaeda in sub-Saharan countries and a transit
route for Islamist fighters heading to Syria's civil war. People
traffickers also use the remote desert borders with Egypt, Sudan, Niger and
Chad to smuggle refugees into Libya from where many try to reach Europe by
boat. Authorities
deported 350 illegal immigrants from Niger and 208 from Chad via its remote
al-Tum crossing to Niger, Lana reported late on Tuesday, citing a security
official. In total 4 875
illegal immigrants of various nationalities were being held in detention centres,
the agency said. Hundreds of
illegal migrants have died in the past two months on their way from North
Africa to Italy. Many set off in small boats from the Libyan coast which
authorities struggle to monitor. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
