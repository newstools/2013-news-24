What matters is respect for the academic rules. As for the rest, everyone is free to do as they please", he said.Mats are available for those who wish to pray while using IDEO's library."The sources that can be consulted here are very rare and often not found elsewhere," said student Alaa Badawi.Khadiga el-Gaafar, a veiled student immersed in a copy of the Encyclopedia Islamica, said the institute "can compete with American libraries."The tranquility of the space and its heaving bookshelves are not IDEO's only strengths, the centre has also developed a software programme - alKindi - for researching catalogues on Arab culture.The European Union is financing a study of 200 classical authors of Arabic-Muslim heritage.IDEO hopes that in the face of increasingly radical discourse, works to contextualise these authors will allow a more "nuanced, less fundamentalist, more pertinent" view of their writings.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
