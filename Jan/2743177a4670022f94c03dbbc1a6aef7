The new pipeline is expected to ease some of the burden.KPC's existing pipeline runs From Mombasa to Nairobi, and onwards to the town of Nakuru in the west, and then forks to two other towns in the region Eldoret and Kisumu.Kenya and Uganda also hope to revive plans to extend the pipeline past Eldoret to Uganda's capital Kampala, a distance of about 350km, to give Uganda an option for accessing its fuel, much of which is transported by road.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
