This is what we are fulfilling," he told Ethiopia's parliament.Hailemariam said Addis Ababa was paying for its military mission in Somalia from its own coffers and Western diplomats say financial issues are one of the main reasons behind Ethiopia's discontent, along with strained relations with Mogadishu and Amisom.African countries which sent troops into Somalia under the Amisom banner are compensated by the African Union but Ethiopian troops do not operate within that framework.Al-Shabaab has been greatly weakened since late September when Kenyan troops forced it to withdraw from the port of Kismayu, its last major urban stronghold.But analysts say they doubt Ethiopia is set for a full withdrawal and Hailemariam suggested Ethiopia could continue its fight against al-Shabaab, but in other parts of Somalia."Somalia is one of Ethiopia's main security interest zones, so I don't think they would change policy drastically," said one Nairobi-based Western diplomat."It's in Ethiopia's own interest that Somalia stays in tact and that gains achieved are not lost once again." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
