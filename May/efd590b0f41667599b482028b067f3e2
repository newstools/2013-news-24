the coast of Nigeria in West Africa and abducted an unknown number of crew,
security sources said on Tuesday. Increasing piracy in the Gulf of Guinea region, which
includes Africa's No 1 oil producer Nigeria and is a significant source of
cocoa and metals for world markets, is jacking up costs for shipping firms
operating there. The Nigerian-flagged MT Matrix was boarded by gunmen in the
early hours of Saturday around 40 nautical miles off the coast of oil-producing
Bayelsa state, two security sources said, in a stretch of water often targeted
by pirates in recent months. There were 12 Pakistani and five Nigerian crew aboard the
vessel when it was attacked, one of the sources said. A spokesperson for ship operator Val Oil Trading, who declined
to give his name, confirmed there had been an "incident", without
giving further details. Last month there were two attacks in the Gulf of Guinea
where foreigners were kidnapped and released a few weeks later. Security
sources believe ransoms were paid - an increasingly lucrative business for
criminal gangs. International navies have not launched counter-piracy
missions in the Gulf of Guinea, leaving the many vessels that anchor off
Nigeria vulnerable to attack. On the other, eastern side of Africa, piracy that was once a
scourge off the coast of Somalia has been largely brought under control by
international naval patrols and the stationing of armed guards aboard merchant
vessels.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
