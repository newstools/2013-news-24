The overwhelming likelihood is that there are a great deal of top-level documents concerning the participation of top-level officials."He contended that neither Nxesi nor the director general made any effort to find out if there were any other documents, and said it was clear no proper search was done at head office.He described as "very odd" the department's contention that there was no specific budget for the project, and that funds were sourced from "other prestige projects" that were under-utilised.He described as "ludicrous" the suggestion that the project manager Jean Rindel "went to the president and negotiated a R200 million contract with him", but that there were no records of any reports by the project team to top management or reports to the president about the progress of the project."...There is ample evidence that all these meetings and decision-making took place, but the department says it has no such records," said Trengove."...The court will have to decide whether or not the denials of the respondents are honest or not," he said.Danny Berger SC, for the respondents, argued that the centre's request was "open-ended", because it now sought access to "any document held anywhere" which held a connection to Nkandla.He said this was certainly not how the application had started out, when the applicant had sought only access to documents held by the state pertaining to goods or services in relation to the upgrade of Nkandla and which related to the financial implications of the project.He said that as a result of the disclosure of 12 253 pages, it now knew precisely how much money had been spent on Nkandla and how it had been spent."We make no excuses in respect of the failure of the respondents to comply with the act in respect of their obligations."The court can say whatever needs to be said about that, but there came a time when there was a change of course and the respondents realised they needed to disclose whatever documents they could disclose," he said.Berger argued that it was "unreasonable" to expect of the respondents to go through more than 12 000 pages and explain the reasons for each and every document that was incomplete.He said it was not even clear that there were documents missing.Judge Vuyelwa Tlhapi remarked that there was only one huge project involved and merely different aspects of the same project.The application continues.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
