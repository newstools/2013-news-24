The minister has condemned the incident, especially in view of it being allegedly committed by a law enforcer who is expected to protect citizens,” spokesperson Mthunzi Mhaga said in a statement yesterday. “This incident flies in the face of government’s tireless efforts of addressing the escalating rate of sexual violence against women and children.” News channel eNCA reported that the incident took place in Kliprivier, south of Johannesburg, last week. The teenager and her cousin were walking along a pathway when a man driving an Opel Corsa cornered them. They said he used pepper spray on them, before forcing the blinded girl into his car. He then parked in a ditch in Kliprivier where he allegedly raped her. Two passing policemen grew suspicious when they spotted the vehicle in the ditch. They stopped to investigate, and caught the policeman in the act. The policeman, who has since been arrested, faces charges of statutory rape. He would appear in the Vereeniging Magistrates’ Court tomorrow to apply for bail, eNCA reported. Mhaga said Radebe has assured the girl’s family that “justice will not only be done but manifestly seen to be done”. “Counselling services will be provided to her, as is the practice to all victims of sexual violence,” he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
