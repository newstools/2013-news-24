Sonam Bhagwandas A 20-MINUTE storm caused a tent to collapse, injuring sixteen people, including the local mayor, in the kwaMgayi area on the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast on Wednesday. More than two thousand people had been attending a mayoral imbizo when the storm struck. Spokesperson for the Umzumbe Municipality Trevor Khanyile said one person was critically injured, ten suffered serious injuries and five people had minor injuries.  “One patient was admitted with a head injury for overnight monitoring and nurses say she might be released soon,” said Khanyile. Khanyile said they had been issued with a safety certificate for the tent by an engineer. Media liasion officer for EMRS Robert McKenzie said emergency service vehicles were dispatched immediately and the critical and seriously injured had been transported first to the kwaMgayi clinic. “Those injured were privately transported to the clinic and were then taken to Burton community health centre and GJ Crookes Hospital for further treatment,” said McKenzie. The mayor of Umzumbe Municipality Councillor Sydney Gumede said:“I was busy responding to people’s questions about issues of development when the storm brought the tent down.” A local councillor, Londolo Zungu, was among those injured.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
