threats and lack government protection, with at least ten attacks against the
media in the past year, the Committee to Protect Journalists said on Tuesday. "Despite Tanzania's reputation for transparency and
democracy, its citizens are being denied vital information," the New
York-based CPJ warned in a report criticising "a rise in anti-press
attacks set against a backdrop of repressive laws". The CPJ documented 10 "serious anti-press attacks and
threats" since September 2012. Those include the killing of cameraman Daudi Mwangosi, hit
by a tear-gas canister while covering demonstrations in September, and the
severe beating of editor Absalom Kibanda in March, in which he was blinded in
one eye and had part of his finger hacked off. "The deterioration of press conditions has coincided
with jitters among members of a ruling party unused to criticism and
unaccustomed to political challenge," said CPJ report author Tom Rhodes. Tanzania's ruling party Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM,
Revolutionary Party) has been in power for decades. There was no immediate response from the authorities. "The government of Tanzania's crackdown on freedom of
the press and expression is a clear sign that it feels threatened ahead of the
2015 presidential and parliamentary elections," Rhodes added. The CPJ said that while Tanzania's government has pledged to
reform media laws, little has been put into practice. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
