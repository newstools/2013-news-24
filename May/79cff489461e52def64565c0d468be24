Witness Reporter WITNESS senior writer Trish Beaver made her mark in the Media24 Newspapers 2012/2013 Legends Awards in Cape Town at the weekend. Now running for the fifth year, the awards celebrate the extraordinary editorial, advertising and service achievements in Media24 Newspapers. In the editorial section there were 16 categories, and Beaver, despite going up against journalists from some of the bigger titles in the Media24 stable, scooped the Lifestyle Journalist of the Year. “I’m thrilled to receive this prestigious award. It is a huge incentive for ordinary journalists to try their best and to never stop trying. My motivation has always been to write stories that touch people and that is what gives me job satisfaction. This award is the cherry on the top,” said Beaver. — Witness Reporter. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
