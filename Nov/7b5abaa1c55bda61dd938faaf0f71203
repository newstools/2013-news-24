	     Richards Bay - A man who allegedly drove his car into
Richards Bay harbour on Tuesday night, while his 10-month-old daughter was
seated in the vehicle, has been charged with attempted murder. Richards Bay police spokesperson Captain Debbie Ferreira
said the man drove his VW Passat into the water at the Slipway shortly after 19:00. A police source said the man swam to safety with his
daughter and was found on the quay side. Ferreira said the man appeared in court on Wednesday. He was
remanded in custody until 12 November. The source said the man had apparently had an argument with
his wife and afterwards sped his car off the quay wall and into the deep water.
The baby was taken to the Bay Hospital where she is being monitored. The police’s Richards Bay Operational Response Service and
Sea Borders unit rushed to the scene and the man was arrested. “Visibility was too poor on Tuesday evening to get the
vehicle out,” said Marvic shareholder Rueban Govender. On Wednesday morning, police divers and Marvic Towing and
Recovery managed to retrieve the vehicle from the sea. Last year, Vijen Naidoo and his two sons, Yuvesh, 5, and
Cameron, 2, drowned after their father allegedly drove his Toyota Tazz into the
Richards Bay harbour.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
