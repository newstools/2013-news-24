Hefcom's bid was also half the cost of Edison's.According to the Mail &amp; Guardian, a letter informing Edison it had won the bid was dated before City Power supply chain management even received the bid recommendation or the chair of the adjudication committee had signed off on the decision.Edison's share of the contract was increased from the initial recommendation of a R600m share of an R800m contract to an exclusive contract for R1.25bn.The City and its utility City Power, which procured the meters, had denied any irregularities, according to the newspaper.According to the report there was no evidence suggesting foul play on the part of Reddy or Edison.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
