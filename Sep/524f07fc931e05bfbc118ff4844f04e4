	     Mogadishu - The forced eviction of thousands of Somalia's
poorest from makeshift camps amid rebuilding efforts in the war-ravaged capital
Mogadishu has led to "large scale" rights abuses, Amnesty
International warned on Friday. More than 300 000 people live in basic camps across
Mogadishu, often in the ruins of once grand buildings and consisting of little
more than plastic sheeting or cloth draped over stick frames. But since al-Qaeda-linked Shabaab fighters fled city
trenches two years ago, bands of labourers have been rebuilding Mogadishu, with
the vast tented camps being cleared for development. Some residents have been forced to shift to often dangerous
areas on the city outskirts, outside the effective control of security forces,
Amnesty added. "It is completely unacceptable for people who have fled
to the capital for protection to be forcibly evicted," said Amnesty's
Somalia researcher Gemma Davies. "It has resulted in large scale human
rights abuses." Thousands of people have long lived amid the ruins of the
seaside capital, which became a byword for anarchy after the collapse of the
government in 1991, but tens of thousands more flooded the city two years ago
fleeing extreme drought and famine. "For decades, Somalia's people have been pushed from
place to place by conflict, famine and drought," Amnesty said. "Now the country finally has a central government, it's
high time to focus on a durable solution for Somalia's displaced that allows
them to be part of the country's reconstruction." Somalia's new government, selected last year by clan elders
in a United Nations-backed process, is working to restore stability after two
decades of chaos. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
