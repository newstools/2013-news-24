Mlondi RadebeA PINETOWN businessman, Charles Ferreira (36), escaped unharmed after his vehicle caught fire on the N2 near Park Rynie on Tuesday morning.Ferreira said he was driving in the fast lane when a group of young men threw a fire cracker through the back window of his car. In just a few minutes his car was engulfed in flames.Ferreira told The Witness yesterday he found it difficult to explain the incident that destroyed his Kia Sportage or the motive behind it.He said a group of men aged between 18 to 20 were in an Isuzu bakkie travelling behind him. &ldquo;The driver of the bakkie was flicking his lights from behind while the group was shouting &lsquo;Pull over, pull over!&rsquo;. I was scared and didn&rsquo;t know what to do. &ldquo;When the bakkie overtook me the young men threw a fire cracker into my car. I immediately stopped at the roadside and jumped out to inspect what they threw into my car.&ldquo;Everything happened so fast. &ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t know why they did this to me. I have no idea who they are and I don&rsquo;t remember seeing that vehicle before.&rdquo; Ferreira said the young men were laughing at him as they drove off. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ludicrous. I still don&rsquo;t understand why they did this. How can this happen and why would anyone think something like this is funny? &ldquo;I still feel sick to the stomach and can&rsquo;t help but getting emotional when I talk about it.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what the youth of this country is coming to&hellip;&rdquo;In his dismay, he said, he thought about his family and remembered cases where unsuspecting people ended up dead. &ldquo;I was thinking of what could have happened to me. My family would find my lifeless body next to the road,&rdquo; said Ferreira.Police spokesperson Captain Thulani Zwane said a case of malicious damage to property was being investigated. &ldquo;No arrests have been made, but witnesses can contact the Scottburgh police station,&rdquo; he added.&bull; mlondi.radebe@witness.co.za24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
