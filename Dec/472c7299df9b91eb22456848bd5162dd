The SOS: Support Public Broadcasting Coalition has added its voice to that of Media Monitoring Africa (MMA) in calling for an investigation into the SABC s ban on broadcasting the booing of President Jacob Zuma at former president Nelson Mandela's memorial service, in news broadcasts.City Press yesterday broke the story that various instructions were given to ban broadcasts of the booing. This was confirmed by six independent sources at the public broadcaster s news division.The coalition said in a statement: SOS acknowledges the fact that many citizens thought the booing was inappropriate given the gravity and importance of the ceremony. However, despite these concerns, Coalition members believe strongly that the incident was newsworthy and the SABC, as our public broadcaster, should have covered it. The decision to deliberately omit the information constitutes a clear violation of the SABC s editorial policies. The coalition has asked that SABC group CEO, Lulama Mokhobo, urgently investigate the matter and to brief the public on its terms, progress and outcomes . The coalition includes MMA, Cosatu, the South African Screen Federation and the Freedom of Expression Institute.http://youtu.be/x8Rhfj2IVOI24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
