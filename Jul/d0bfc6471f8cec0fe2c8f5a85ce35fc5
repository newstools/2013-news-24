"That means you live in a country of various political beliefs," said Kathrada.The principle was evident in how the country turned out."He [Mandela] said we have to live in the same country with the same people with the message of forgiveness, with the message of looking forward, reconciliation and going forward with a stronger united South Africa," said Kathrada.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
