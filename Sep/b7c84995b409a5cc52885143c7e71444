of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice newspaper in Cairo, the latest
move aimed at crushing the Islamist movement, the Brotherhood said on
Wednesday. "We the journalists of the Freedom and Justice
newspaper condemn the security forces for closing down the headquarters of the
newspaper," the Brotherhood said in a statement posted on its Facebook
page. Police stormed the building overnight and removed the
contents. A source at the Cairo Security Department said the raid followed
Monday's court ruling which banned the Brotherhood and ordered its funds
seized. "A court ruling was issued to do it on charges of
inciting violence and terrorism in the recent past," a security source
said, referring to the operation. The army overthrew Mohammed Morsi in July, and the
Brotherhood has seen hundreds of its members killed and thousands arrested
since then. The campaign had forced many of the 50 journalists who
produced the daily Freedom and Justice to work in secret to avoid arrest. The newspaper, named after the Brotherhood's political wing,
had focused on efforts to reverse what it called a military coup against an
elected government. The Brotherhood emerged from the shadows to win
parliamentary and presidential elections after autocrat Hosni Mubarak was
overthrown in 2011. Many Egyptians became disillusioned with Morsi after he gave
himself sweeping powers and mismanaged the economy, taking to the streets in
protest and prompting the army move. They now revere the man who toppled Mursi - army chief
General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
