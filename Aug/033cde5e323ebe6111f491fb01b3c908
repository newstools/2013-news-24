	     On Friday evening, a beaming Nomsa Galant became the Cinderella of Blikkiesdorp in Cape Town. Local councillors worked throughout the day to give the 18-year-old Leiden High School pupil a lift – literally – en route to her matric dance. The ground around Galant’s corrugated house was flooded after merciless cold fronts lashed Cape Town with rain this week. “She would have had to walk 5m in water to get to a car,” Charles Esau, city councillor for the area, told City Press. “We really try to encourage children in Blikkiesdorp to complete their schooling and we’re very proud of Nomsa,” he said. “So we decided to help her to get over the water. I don’t want her pretty dress or shoes to be spoiled. It’s her special night.” Esau and his colleagues dumped sand at Galant’s house on Friday morning, working all day to build a dry walkway fit for a matric dance queen. Galant beamed while preparing for the bash on Friday afternoon. “I’m very, very excited,” she said. “Yes, there was a big dam of water in front of my house. The council people filled it up with sand; they’ve been busy since the morning.” Galant wore a bronze dress with black shoes. She had her hair done at a salon in Bellville. The teenager and her date, Merlin Bowers, were chauffeured to the matric ball at a Cape Town hotel in a Mercedes-Benz belonging to their friends. Blikkiesdorp is a notoriously dangerous township named after its trademark corrugated iron homes. It is built on a dusty plain, 30km outside the city. “We moved to Blikkiesdorp in 2008. It is a violent place. Our house was broken into just last Sunday,” said Galant. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
