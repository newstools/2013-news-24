"It exists in every cocoa-growing community."In 2007, the UN children's agency Unicef put the number of child cocoa labourers in Ivory Coast at 200 000, with most originating from the centre and north of the country, as well as from Burkina Faso and Togo.That same year, Tulane University in the United States estimated that 820 000 children in Ivory Coast and one million in Ghana were working in "cocoa-linked activities".Cocoa and coffee growers A shortage of schools in the region, coupled with the need of poor parents to send their children out to earn money, has made child labour widespread.A quarter of children aged 5-17 are already working in Ivory Coast, according to a recent report from the International Labour Organisation (ILO), with over half of those employed in agriculture.Nearly a quarter work in business and 10% are in industry, the report said.About a fifth of the children working in agriculture are cocoa and coffee growers, who typically work over 42 hours a week, the ILO said.But the International Cocoa Initiative said it believed the situation was improving, with figures suggesting child labour had decreased by 20% in Ghana and Ivory Coast in recent years.Ivory Coast has spent 20 million CFA francs ($41 000) to build schools, pharmacies and invest in electricity in efforts to reduce child labour, an industry representative said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
