"We have been carrying out frequent surprise inspections at mines to crack down on this problem."There are more than 800 000 miners working in small-scale gold operations in Tanzania, thousands of whom are children, the rights group said."They dig and drill in deep, unstable pits, work underground for shifts of up to 24 hours, and transport and crush heavy bags of gold ore," said the report titled, "Toxic Toil: Child Labour and Mercury Exposure in Tanzania's Small-Scale Gold Mines."The government has pledged to end the practice, but Human Rights Watch said it was not doing enough."On paper, Tanzania has strong laws prohibiting child labour in mining, but the government has done far too little to enforce them," said Janine Morna, a researcher at the rights group."Labour inspectors need to visit both licensed and unlicensed mines regularly and ensure employers face sanctions for using child labour," she said.The group said girls who work on or near mining sites sometimes become victims of sexual exploitation and abuse. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
