Under the new law, this could incur a fine of $63m.Environmental campaigners say this is an underestimate and the real figure could be several times that.In later years far less was spilled due to the company's error, it says.Costly Oil companies would have to report oil spills within 24 hours to the regulator or be fined $3 156 per day thereafter. They would also have to submit 0.05% of their operating budget to help fund the regulator."Only if polluting the environment becomes more costly than cleaning it up will the situation change for the better," said Senator Bukola Saraki, head of the senate's environment board.Saraki's team said they hoped a vote on the bill would be held by the end of the year.A Shell spokesperson declined to comment on the proposed law.Legislation is often difficult to enforce in Nigeria, where a patronage culture and widespread corruption create loopholes, according to watchdogs including Transparency International.Clauses in the new law say the new regulator would set the salaries and benefits for its members itself and it would be allowed to accept gifts, including property and cash.Amnesty International critized Shell this week, saying it manipulated the results of oil spill investigations to avoid paying fines or damaging its reputation. The company strongly denied the allegations.Amnesty also criticised the Nigerian government for not having a more well-equipped oil spill regulator.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
