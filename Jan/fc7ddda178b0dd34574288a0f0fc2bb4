They will go on to destroy the [Roman] sites in Carthage, El Jem and Duga. Then they will force men to grow beards and women to wear the full veil," he said.According to the union, which urged Tunisia's Islamist-led government to take effective action, such attacks are financed from abroad.Since the early centuries of Islam, Sufi orders have always aroused suspicion among orthodox Muslims.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
