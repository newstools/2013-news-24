All inmates entering correctional services facilities will, in future, be screened for tuberculosis (TB). Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said correctional facilities have been identified as among the places where TB is prevalent, the SABC reported yesterday. “Early diagnosis means early enrolment onto treatment programmes and a reduction in chances of infecting others, thus significantly improving the overall performance of our TB control,” said Motsoaledi. South Africa’s correctional facilities were said to be the worst affected on the African continent. Motsoaledi donated state of the art GeneXpert machines to correctional facilities that can diagnose TB within a period of two hours. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
