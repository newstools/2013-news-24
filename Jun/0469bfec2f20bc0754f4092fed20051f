He was ordered to pay the costs."Given the fact that Dr Mahfouz has been dismissed from the public service, and therefore cannot practise as a general practitioner, public service, the practical effect is that he may not practise medicine in South Africa," the council said.HPCSA CEO Buyiswa Mjamba-Matshoba said the council had not taken the decision lightly.Mjamba-Matshoba condemned the practice of some doctors exploiting the remunerative work outside public service programme."The HPCSA is concerned about the abuse of this system and the unintended consequence for patients," she said."We would like to remind practitioners that it is unethical to leave patients unattended."The HPCSA would contact the health department to address the "unintended consequences" of the abuse of the system.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
