Windhoek – A Mozambique Airlines plane en route to Angola crashed in a game park in northeast Namibia killing all 34 people on board, say Namibian police. Flight TM 470 left Maputo yesterday for the Angolan capital of Luanda with 28 passengers and six crew members on board when it lost contact with air traffic controllers, the airline said today in a statement. Deputy commissioner of the Namibian Police Force, Willy Bampton, said rescue workers had found burnt wreckage of the aircraft in the dense bush of Bwabwata National Park near the borders with Angola and Botswana. “The plane has been completely burnt to ashes and there are no survivors,” Bampton said. Namibia's aircraft investigation unit launched a helicopter search for the plane yesterday afternoon, but called it off because of heavy rains, an investigator said, adding that the search had resumed this morning. The remote, 6?100km² park is home to wildlife including elephants, lions and wild dogs. Mozambican officials said the plane, an Embraer SA 190, went missing in bad weather and conditions of poor visibility. Quoting the Chinese Embassy in Mozambique, Chinese news agency Xinhua said one Chinese national was on board. Also among the passengers were 10 Mozambicans, nine Angolans, five Portuguese, one French and one Brazilian, Xinhua said, citing the airline. The flight left the Mozambican capital of Maputo yesterday morning and had been due to arrive in Luanda yesterday afternoon. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
