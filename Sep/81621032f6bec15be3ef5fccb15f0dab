Cape Town - A 40-year-old former Zimbabwean cricketer got the shock of his life when he discovered a massive 2.4-metre crocodile had spent the night hiding under his bed, according to a report. The crocodile sneaked into the Hunami lodge on the Save Conservancy in the Lowveld in Zimbabwe and spent the entire night just centimetres beneath an oblivious Guy Whittall, the Daily Star said. Whittall, who is a director at the lodge, said the most disconcerting thing about the whole episode was the fact that he had sat on the edge of the bed that morning, barefoot, unaware the 150kg reptile lay just centimetres from his dangling feet.He was only alerted to the bizarre scenario when he was enjoying breakfast in the kitchen and heard the petrified screams of a cleaner, said the report.Whittal s co-workers helped remove the crocodile from its new lair and released him back into Humani's Chigwidi dam.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
