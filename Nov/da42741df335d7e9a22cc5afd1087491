Everyone opened their eyes [and] found that there were three young men wearing balaclavas. They had guns in their hands," said Mhlanga.The attackers demanded cellphones, money, rings, earrings, jackets, car keys, and other valuable items. They ordered young girls and women to follow them outside."This was like a movie to us... Two remained behind to guard us as one of them took a woman with him outside. The one who went outside would come back and the next guy would follow and they rotated the women in that manner."They allegedly sexually assaulted the women and raped a 21-year-old.Mpumalanga police spokesperson Colonel Leonard Hlathi said a case of rape and robbery was being investigated.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
