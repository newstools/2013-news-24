The heavy rains across Kenya have displaced about 4 000 households, or more than 18 630 people, the emergency service provider said. Most of those displaced were in western Kenya. "The most common destruction in these areas is collapsed latrines, contamination of water sources, and total collapse of houses, food stores destroyed, farms swept away and livestocks dead," said Red Cross spokesperson Nelly Mulika. Key roads have also been washed away or severely damaged by the flooding, and authorities have urged commuters to find alternative routes. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
