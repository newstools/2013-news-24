It also carries parasites that can infect humans with the disease meningitis, which can in some cases be fatal.The last major Australian outbreak of the snail was in 1977, when 300 giant snails were exterminated in Queensland in an intensive eight-month campaign of community education, baiting and snail collection.The snail was destroyed and officials inspected the container yard and found no evidence of additional snails, eggs or snail trails. They will continue surveillance into next week."Australia's strict bio-security requirements and responsive system has so far kept these pests out of Australia, and we want to keep it that way," Nixon said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
