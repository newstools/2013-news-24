they are boycotting coverage of the information minister in protest after two
major newspapers were suspended for sedition. Authorities last week suspended the privately-owned
Mwananchi and MTanzania for 14 and 90 days respectively for publishing
"hostile articles aimed at inciting the people to lose confidence in state
institutions and thus endanger peace and national unity," a government statement
said. Another newspaper, Mwanahalisi, has remained closed since it
was ordered shut in July 2012. Media groups including organisations of media owners,
editors, the national media council and the journalists' union said in a
statement that they had decided "for an indefinite period" not to
provide coverage of the Minister of Information Fennela Mukangara and her
deputy. The Committee to Protect Journalists has criticised Tanzania
for often relying "on an arsenal of anti-media laws" that allows the
information ministry "wide discretionary powers to ban" publications. Rights groups and Tanzania's political opposition have
condemned the newspaper closures, as has the European Union delegation in the
east African country. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
