ANC Gauteng deputy chair Gwen Ramokgopa said the three-day annual provincial general council was dedicated to Mandela."We are claiming him as one of one own," she said."We want to acknowledge him as a comrade who not only stood for the ANC as a servant of the people of South Africa; he [also] stood for values of human rights and justice universally."The delegates, dressed in white T-shirts bearing Mandela's image and the words "Long live Nelson Mandela", sang numerous struggle songs dedicated to the anti-apartheid icon.Mandela was admitted to a Pretoria hospital on 8 June with a recurring lung infection.Throngs of well-wishers, senior politicians and family members have visited the Medi-Clinic Heart Hospital since then and have left tributes outside.On Thursday night, the presidency denied claims that Mandela was in a vegetative state."We confirm our earlier statement released this [Thursday] afternoon after President Jacob Zuma visited Madiba in hospital that Madiba remains in a critical but stable condition," said spokesperson Mac Maharaj."The doctors deny that the former president is in a vegetative state," he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
