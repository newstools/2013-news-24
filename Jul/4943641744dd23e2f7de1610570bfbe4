	     According to City Press, senior advocate Guido Penzhorn
revealed during a keynote address, that President Jacob Zuma offered him the position
of SIU head. During the Institute of Commercial Forensic Practitioners
conference, he said that he had accepted the offer, as he wanted to give back
to his profession, City press reported. Since the resignation of former Judge Willem Heath in
December 2011, the SIU has been without a permanent head.  Advocate Nomvula Mokhatla has been acting as SIU head for
the past 19 months. “The fact that the president invited me to head the SIU
speaks volumes to his commitment in fighting corruption in state institutions,”
Penzhorn said. “Since then, I have heard nothing from the justice
department, who administers the appointment, and simply carried on with my
practice. Whoever the president appoints, I wish him or her all the best in
moulding the SIU into a tool to fight corruption.” Penzhorn played a vital part in the prosecution of
companies constructing the Katze Dam in Lesotho, who received million of rands
worth of bribes. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
