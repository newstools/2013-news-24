He also claimed that two other opposition leaders were planning to escape to South Africa.Banda's spokesperson Mikatazo Wakumelo dismissed Sata's allegation of the former leader seeking to flee, saying simply, "that's not true", but he declined to comment further.Sata, who defeated Banda in 2011 elections, is accused by the opposition of a heavy hand in cracking down on political dissent.Members of the opposition have complained before international forums, saying there are increasing civil rights abuses.The Zambian government is in the process of lifting Banda's immunity over his alleged involvement in corrupt activities during his 2008-11 rule.The former president refused to appear for questioning this month.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
