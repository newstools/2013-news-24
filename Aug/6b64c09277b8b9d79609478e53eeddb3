THE Hawks are checking complaints on alleged misspending of funds in the Pippie se Gesiggie fund, which was established in 2012. Hawks spokesperson Captain Paul Ramaloko confirmed that a whistleblower had complained that money in the funds was being misspent and these complaints were being investigated before a case could be opened. The whistleblower alleges that Anice Kruger, Pippie’s mother, was using money from the fund to finance her lifestyle, Ramaloko said. Sister paper Beeld had earlier reported that the Pippie se Gesiggie funds, into which millions of rands had been donated, is managed by Pippie’s mother, Anice; her father, Erwin and her grandmother, Loesje Barnard. The fund’s constitution states it is a non-profit organisation (NPO) created to give medical and financial help to burn victims. So far the year-old fund has paid for the skin cultivation and transplant of one burn victim, Celiwe Maseko (5) from Kagiso on the West Rand. Both Celiwe and Pippie, who was three when she was badly burned, are undergoing extensive rehabilitation. Pippie’s trauma has regressed her development to that of a few-months-old baby. Anice yesterday said through her spokesperson, Lynne Zurnamer, that there was nothing illegal in how the fund was being managed. “It is not against the law to have family members as directors of an NPO,” Zurnamer said. Kruger had earlier told Beeld the fund would be audited in July, but according to Zurnamer the audit will only be done early in September. “The audit would have been done at the end of September, but we will make it earlier to show everyone that there are no irregularities.” Zurnamer said the whistleblower is Lindy Cant, the woman who had earlier administered the Facebook page for Pippie’s Angels. Cant, who lives in Richards Bay, denied that she had complained to the Hawks.
