Most of the passengers were Dutch tourists. A 9-year-old boy was the only survivor."The investigation concluded that the accident proved to be the result of a lack of co-ordination among the crew, caused by several factors, including the psychological state that the crew was in due to the length of the trip," Captain Nasereddin Shaebelain, director general of the Libyan Civil Aviation Authority, told AP in a video interview in Tripoli.The final report of a two-year investigation, which was released on Friday, confirmed that the plane did not have mechanical failures and did not run out of fuel. It pointed to communication errors and faulty procedures by the flight crew."The pilots' performance was likely impaired because of fatigue," but that the extent to which this contributed to the crash could not be determined, the aviation authority said.The Libyan authority was assisted in the investigation by US and European experts as well as Airbus, which built the A330-202 plane.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
