Sonam BhagwandasA SECOND Metrorail train accident has taken place in Durban within a space of a month, this time near the Berea Road train station, leaving 11 people injured.A Durban Metro police officer said the train driver who was responsible for the accident had allegedly not stopped at a red light.&ldquo;From what we were able to gather from the scene, the driver did not stop when she was supposed to and therefore crashed into the oncoming train,&rdquo; said the officer.Various emergency services and Metro police made their way to the scene to assist the injured.According to KwaZulu-Natal Emergency Services spokesperson Robert McKenzie, at around 10.20&thinsp;am yesterday, the trains collided, causing serious injuries to one of the occupants.&ldquo;When we arrived at the scene there was one person who was critically injured and 10 other patients who were injured. Two of the patients had to be removed by emergency services from the wreckage of the two trains. One of the patients who was entrapped remains in a critical condition and has been transported to a private hospital,&rdquo; said McKenzie.The other patients were transported to several hospitals in the Durban area including, King Edward VIII Hospital, for further care. Three people were uninjured and refused medical care.The actual cause of the accident at this stage is unknown and will be investigated.Commuters were inconvenienced with delays for the remainder of yesterday as the line was closed. The derailed train and its carriages were removed and the track was cleared.&bull; The Witness had reported in November that a train derailed while travelled alongside Greenwood Park.The Metrorail train &mdash; which was heading from the Duff&rsquo;s Road station towards Durban&rsquo;s city centre, stopped just short of a home alongside the tracks. An embankment prevented the train from hurtling headlong into the property. Three passengers were injured in the incident. Initial reports suggested that a concrete block had been placed on the track, causing the train to derail.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
