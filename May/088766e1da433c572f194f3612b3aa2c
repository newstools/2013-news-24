For more than a week, Ugandans have been protesting the closure of two major newspapers and a radio station by local authorities. Police have used tear gas to break up the protests.

"After all this time, we are back to operations."The closures have sparked angry demonstrations by journalists and their supporters, with scuffles breaking out on Tuesday and Wednesday as reporters tried to breach the police cordon, and officers beating them back with batons and firing tear gas.The United Nations and European Union both condemned the newspaper closures."It's disturbing that intimidation and harassment are being used in retaliation against the exercise of freedom of expression," the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said last week."Ahead of the 2016 elections, the current events may serve to reinforce self-censorship and severely constrict freedom of opinion and expression at a key moment in Uganda's political development."Media watchdogs including the US-based Committee to Protect Journalists, France-based Reporters Sans Frontieres (RSF - Reporters Without Borders) and the Foreign Correspondents' Association of Uganda all also condemned the closures.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
