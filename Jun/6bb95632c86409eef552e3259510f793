In Mauritania we stayed for a bit, but it's not the same as here," added Blessing.At the gates of a Europe in crisis, Morocco at least offers the migrants stability, and there are some organisations to support them, such as the East-West Foundation which receives about 800 visitors annually."When migrants arrived in the early 2000s, Morocco was not ready and they were badly managed. But since then there has been a marked improvement and today we can carry out all our activities without any problems," said the foundation's president Yasmina Filali.With the support of half a dozen local and international groups various assistance programmes have emerged, notably for schooling."Some have seen terrible things... [and so] school is a lifeline," said Filali.After taking courses in Darija, or Moroccan Arabic, the children have a chance of being integrated in public schools, as was Blessing's younger sister - she came "first in her class.""This is a real success. In the past three years, 150 children have been integrated in all," Filali added.But while there have been successes, there are also lot of real difficulties."Some are in very precarious situations. Only when they have been able to meet their basic needs can they concentrate on other things" like work, said Anna Prieur, a French volunteer with the UNHCR.But it is impossible for them to find work outside the informal sector and sometimes the only means of subsistence is the modest aid provided by the UNHCR, which is reserved for the most vulnerable.Budget management workshop The UN agency says the kingdom "can do more", especially in offering the refugees legal status, which would enable them to look for regular work and protect them from predatory landlords.Attending a "budget management workshop" organised by the Prieur, Ronaldo has mixed feelings about his stay in Morocco - where he says he has experienced "discrimination" and an overbearing sense of loneliness."I came alone, I live alone, I'm always alone, even though I have found friends among the refugees," he said.Trained in hotel management, he sees his life as being outside Africa."I believe this is just the first step," he adds.But Blessing, the Congolese girl, is more upbeat."At first it was not easy, the environment, racist reactions, for example from proprietors. But over time we have learnt to integrate ... to avoid problems."Some "could be fully integrated," said the East-West Foundation's Filali."But we remain a host country by default. There is always an attraction to Europe, even if the situation is not good here or there."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
