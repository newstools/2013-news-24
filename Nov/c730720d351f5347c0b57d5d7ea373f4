A Nigerian defence spokesman said he had no information about refugees crossing the border. Nigerian emergency service officials were not available for comment.The rising number of refugees in Niger is expected to put further strain on food supplies after a disappointing harvest.According to an October report by FEWS NET, a USaid-funded famine network, 1.2 million people in Niger will be in a situation of acute food insecurity from January 2014.Thousands of refugees have also spilled into Cameroon, prompting Nigeria to reach out for help in policing their shared border.The United Nations has called on neighbouring countries to keep their borders open and has urged Niger to grant refugee status to the Nigerian nationals in the Diffa region. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
