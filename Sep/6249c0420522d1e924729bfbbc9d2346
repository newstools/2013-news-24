He was in the neutral zone, not in Rwanda," said Olivier Hamuli, spokesperson for the Congolese army in the North-Kivu province, of which Goma is the capital.The Rwandan authorities said they had arrested a "heavily armed" soldier in their territory.The Rwandan army, in a statement, said the soldier had been carrying out "suspect activities" in the town of Rubavu, which is separated from Goma by the border between the two countries.The incident comes amid continuing tension between Kigali and Kinshasa over a rebellion in and around Goma.Kinshasa and the United Nations accuse Rwanda of being actively involved in the rebellion by the M23, a group of former rebels who were integrated in the army in 2009 but mutinied again last year.TensionsRwanda in turn has accused the Congolese army of firing rockets and mortar shells on its territory and has massed troops at the border, sparking fears of a further regionalisation of the conflict."It was the population that alerted the authorities" to Sunday's kidnapping, the army spokesperson said. "Tensions are running high among residents, who see this as a provocation, and we are trying to calm things down."A witness told AFP that several hundred angry residents briefly massed at two border crossings in Goma following the incident, forcing them to close for several hours.Hamuli explained that the neutral zone was a street of five to 7m &nbsp;in width separating Goma from Gisenyi, its twin city on the Rwandan side of the border.He said the Joint Verification Mechanism, a multinational team of military officers set up by the Great Lakes regional body last year in a bid to defuse the M23 crisis, would look into the incident.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
