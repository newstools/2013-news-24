	     Johannesburg - Twenty-eight people have been arrested in
Jeppestown for hijacking a building, the Hawks said on Wednesday. Captain Paul Ramaloko said they were arrested on Tuesday
night. He said the group had not respected an order of the South
Gauteng High Court instructing them to leave the building. The order was served
in December. "They are facing charges of contempt of court,
malicious damaged to property and trespassing." Ramaloko said a charge of housebreaking could also be added. "Five women who had children under 5-years were
released on warning. They were warned to appear in court [on Wednesday]." He said the rest of the group was also expected to appear in
the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court on Wednesday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
