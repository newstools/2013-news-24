The contentious part is a largely undeveloped swathe of the lake, where Malawi has awarded a licence to British firm Surestream to explore for oil in the northeastern waters near Tanzania.The 29 600km body of water is Africa's third-largest freshwater lake and lies in the Great Lakes system stretching along the East African Rift. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
