	     Johannesburg - A man has been arrested for being in
possession of items used to create various falsified licences and permits,
Gauteng traffic police said on Saturday. "The documents discovered are used to produce motor
vehicle licence discs, temporary drivers' licence, temporary permits, taxi
permits, learners' licences and discs for trailers," spokesperson Obed
Sibasa said. Johannesburg testing station stamps, a false ID document and
a computer allegedly used to produce false documents were amongst the items
seized. Syndicate  "The arrest came after months of investigation and
following up on [a] suspected syndicate, believed to operating across South
Africa and outside the country." The 37-year-old man, from Nigeria, was arrested late Friday
afternoon outside the Gauteng traffic police offices on Kruis Street in the Johannesburg
CBD. Gauteng was at the moment experiencing a high rate of fatal
road accidents, with many of the cars involved having false roadworthy
certificates, licence discs and other documentation, said Sibasa. "Authorities will visit people already issued with the
unlawful documents as part of the investigation." Gauteng traffic police urged the public to go through the
correct channels when registering their cars, applying for licences and when
visiting testing stations. "Gauteng traffic police and national crime intelligence
are investigating, also looking for the ringleader and other suspects belonging
to the alleged syndicate," said Sibasa. "We hope to make an arrest soon." The man was in custody at the Johannesburg police station
and the investigation continued. He was expected to appear in the Johannesburg Magistrate's
Court on Monday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
