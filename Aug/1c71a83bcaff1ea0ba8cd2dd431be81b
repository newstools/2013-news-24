He said the shipment would help "supply power plants hit by gas shortages during the summer season and at a time of high electricity consumption."Qatar's aid follows packages worth $12bn in assistance to Egypt's interim government announced by fellow Gulf states Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.
