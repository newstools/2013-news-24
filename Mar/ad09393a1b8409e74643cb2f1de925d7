Members of Parliament want Mineral Resources Minister Susan Shabangu to set up a new entity to monitor progress on the implementation of the Mining Charter. Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Mineral Resources has recommended the department consider establishing an agency to verify completed Mining Charter scorecards. Tabling the report on public hearings in 2011, the committee said the department must strengthen its compliance monitoring capacity. The proposal to set up a special Mining Charter compliance monitoring body was initially made by the SA Women in Mining Association (Sawima). Acting committee chairperson Faith Bikani said the report would not be adopted because the committee chairperson, Fred Gona, and other members were not present. Gona is off sick, according to Bikani. The committee’s report follows public hearings held in the North West, Gauteng and Parliament in 2011. Ten of the country’s largest mining companies and various organisations such as Sawima, Chamber of Mines and SA Mining Development Association made submissions during the public hearings. The National Union of Mineworkers and Solidarity also made submissions. The committee wants to conduct oversight visits to mining companies to monitor compliance with the Mining Charter. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
