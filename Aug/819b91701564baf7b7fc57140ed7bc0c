The defence department is expected to brief the media in Pretoria today about the deployment of SA National Defence Force troops in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Last week, President Jacob Zuma informed Parliament that 1?345 soldiers had been deployed to the DRC as part of the United Nations Force Intervention Brigade (FIB) in the eastern DRC. The deployment of the FIB followed the passing of a UN resolution in March authorising a force to intervene in cases where negative forces threatened people’s lives and property in the east of the DRC. Zuma said yesterday no South African soldiers had been critically wounded in clashes with rebels in the DRC. “Three of our soldiers have been injured in the conflict since the weekend, largely from shrapnel wounds. None have been seriously wounded,” Zuma told reporters at the Union Buildings in Pretoria. “Our soldiers are well-trained and are ready for their responsibilities towards building a better and more peaceful Africa. South Africa has deployed troops in fulfilment of our international obligations towards the United Nations,” he said.
