	     Cape Town - A 40-year-old former Zimbabwean cricketer got
the shock of his life when he discovered a massive 2.4-metre crocodile had
spent the night hiding under his bed, according to a report.  The crocodile sneaked into the Hunami lodge on the Save
Conservancy in the Lowveld in Zimbabwe and spent the entire night just
centimetres beneath an oblivious Guy Whittall, the Daily Star said.   

 Whittall, who is a director at the lodge, said the most disconcerting
thing about the whole episode was the fact that he had sat on the edge of the
bed that morning, barefoot, unaware the 150kg reptile lay just centimetres from
his dangling feet. He was only alerted to the bizarre scenario when he was
enjoying breakfast in the kitchen and heard the petrified screams of a cleaner,
said the report. Whittal’s co-workers helped remove the crocodile from its
new lair and released him back into Humani's Chigwidi dam.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
