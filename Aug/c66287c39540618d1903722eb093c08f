on Thursday for a campaign to bring the country to a halt, after a disputed
election that has seen President Robert Mugabe's allies claim victory. "There needs to be resistance against this theft and
the people of Zimbabwe need to speak out strongly," the Movement for
Democratic Change's (MDC) Roy Bennett told AFP in Johannesburg. "I'm talking about passive resistance. I'm talking
about people completely shutting the country down - don't pay any bills, don't
attend work, just bring the country to a standstill." Bennett, an aide to Mugabe's long-time rival Morgan
Tsvangirai, spends much of his time outside Zimbabwe after a series of arrests. He remains MDC treasurer. Mugabe's allies declared the veteran leader had romped to
victory in Wednesday's poll. Bennett expressed dismay at an election he described as
an "absolute total sham”. "I'm totally shocked at how badly they've rigged it
and expect to get away with it." "It’s not a case of even rigging it. It's a case of
having totally stolen it. Blatant, outright, daylight theft of the greatest
proportions."   Britain, meanwhile, has expressed concern that Zimbabwe had not enacted important electoral reform before Wednesday's
vote in the former British colony, and by reports that large numbers of voters
had been turned away. "We are also concerned by the late publication of
the electoral roll," a spokesperson for the British Foreign Office told
Reuters. "Any judgement on the credibility of elections will
need to take these factors into account."  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
