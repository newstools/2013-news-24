Animals should still be kept off the affected area after spraying.Farmers who encountered armyworm infestations needed to alert the local animal health technician or state veterinarian.Armyworms are not government-regulated pests, as their population outbreaks occur only once or twice in a decade, usually following outbreaks in Tanzania or Zambia.Weeks said the weather was generally too hot for armyworm to survive in South Africa from April through to winter. As such, new outbreaks were not expected next summer.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
