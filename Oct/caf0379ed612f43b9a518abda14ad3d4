He has been missing since the protests on 30 September and the decapitated body of his body guard was one of those found.Traore was part of the military regime established after the March 2012 coup.He was among dozens of disgruntled soldiers who fired guns in the air and took hostage a close aide of Sanago during the protest on 30 September.The soldiers, based in the garrison town of Kati, near Bamako, were unhappy at not having been promoted alongside colleagues also involved in ousting the president in March last year.The army confirmed the incidents at the time and later announced 30 soldiers had been arrested over them.The 2012 coup precipitated the fall of northern Mali to Islamist militants linked to al-Qaeda but a military intervention by French and African troops in January chased the rebels from the region's main cities.Mali was governed by a transitional administration following the coup until elections saw Ibrahim Boubacar Keita sworn in as the new president in September.Since August, several authors of the coup or their relatives have been handed promotions, including Sanogo who was elevated from captain to lieutenant-general and lives and works in Kati.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
