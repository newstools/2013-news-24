	     Prisons official Huggins Machingauta said on Wednesday
that authorities wanted to give prisoners facing execution a "chance to
live”. He said all death sentences will be brought before the
cabinet of ministers for a review to commute them to life. The hangman's post was vacant for about seven years since
the previous one retired in 2005.  State media reported earlier this month that prison
officials said they found a new hangman. A new proposed draft constitution endorsed by the
country's two main political parties exempts women, men under 21 and those over
70 from the death penalty. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
