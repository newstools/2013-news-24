	     The International Maritime Bureau (IMB), which has a monitoring centre in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, said only eight piracy attacks, including two hijackings, were reported in the area in the first six months of 2013. The IMB put the drop down to naval action and preventative measures taken by commercial vessels, such as hiring private security personnel. "The navies continue to play a vital role in ensuring this threat is under control," Pottengal Mukundan, IMB director, said. The two hijacked vessels were recovered before the pirates could take them to Somalia. IMB said that as of 30 June, Somali pirates were still holding 57 crew members for ransom on four vessels. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
